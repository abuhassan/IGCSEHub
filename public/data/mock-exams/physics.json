    "question": "Which of the following is a scalar quantity?",
    "choices": ["Force", "Velocity", "Acceleration", "Speed"],
    "answer": "Speed",
    "explanation": "Speed has magnitude only, no direction — so it’s a scalar."
  },
  {
    "question": "A car travels 100 km in 2 hours. What is its average speed?",
    "choices": ["25 km/h", "50 km/h", "75 km/h", "100 km/h"],
    "answer": "50 km/h",
    "explanation": "Speed = distance/time = 100 km ÷ 2 h = 50 km/h."
  },
  {
    "question": "What instrument is used to measure current in a circuit?",
    "choices": ["Voltmeter", "Thermometer", "Ammeter", "Ohmmeter"],
    "answer": "Ammeter",
    "explanation": "An ammeter measures current and is connected in series."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which wave property changes when a wave passes from air into water?",
    "choices": ["Amplitude", "Frequency", "Speed", "Wavelength"],
    "answer": "Speed",
    "explanation": "The speed of the wave changes due to the change in medium."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the unit of pressure?",
    "choices": ["Pascal", "Newton", "Joule", "Watt"],
    "answer": "Pascal",
    "explanation": "Pressure is measured in Pascals (Pa), equal to N/m²."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the motion of particles in a solid?",
    "choices": ["They move freely.", "They vibrate in fixed positions.", "They slide past each other.", "They are stationary."],
    "answer": "They vibrate in fixed positions.",
    "explanation": "Particles in a solid vibrate but stay in fixed positions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which quantity is measured in joules?",
    "choices": ["Power", "Force", "Energy", "Voltage"],
    "answer": "Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy is measured in joules (J)."
  },
  {
    "question": "The frequency of a wave is 10 Hz and its wavelength is 2 m. What is its speed?",
    "choices": ["5 m/s", "10 m/s", "20 m/s", "100 m/s"],
    "answer": "20 m/s",
    "explanation": "Speed = frequency × wavelength = 10 × 2 = 20 m/s."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which force keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth?",
    "choices": ["Magnetic force", "Gravitational force", "Friction", "Electrostatic force"],
    "answer": "Gravitational force",
    "explanation": "Gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon keeps it in orbit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements about light is correct?",
    "choices": ["It cannot travel in a vacuum.", "It is a longitudinal wave.", "It travels slower than sound.", "It is a transverse wave."],
    "answer": "It is a transverse wave.",
    "explanation": "Light is a transverse wave and can travel through a vacuum."
