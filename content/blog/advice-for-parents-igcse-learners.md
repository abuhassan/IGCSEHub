Parents play a crucial role in helping students succeed during their IGCSE journey. Here are some helpful ways to support your child:

### 1. Understand the IGCSE System
Learn about:
- Core vs Extended levels
- Grading (A*–G)
- Subject requirements for ICE or further studies

This helps you guide them in setting realistic academic goals.

### 2. Create a Positive Learning Environment
- Set up a distraction-free study space
- Encourage consistent routines
- Help them stay organized with a planner

### 3. Support Without Pressure
- Avoid comparing them to others
- Be encouraging, not overbearing
- Praise effort and progress, not just results

### 4. Encourage Healthy Habits
- Ensure they get enough sleep and nutritious meals
- Promote regular breaks and relaxation
- Keep an eye on stress levels

### 5. Be Involved (But Not Controlling)
- Ask about their revision plans and subjects
- Offer help with scheduling or exam registration
- Let them take the lead on learning

### 6. Use the Right Tools
Support their learning using:
- Mock exams and flashcards
- Study planners (like the one on IGCSEHub!)
- Educational videos or review sessions
