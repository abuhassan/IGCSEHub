Choosing your IGCSE subjects can feel like a big decision — and it is! Your choices may influence what courses or careers you'll be eligible for later. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Know Your Strengths
Ask yourself:
- Which subjects do I enjoy most?
- Where do I naturally do well?

Choosing subjects that play to your strengths makes studying more enjoyable and effective.

### 2. Think About Future Goals
Are you planning to:
- Study science, medicine, or engineering?
- Pursue the arts, business, or law?

Make sure your subject combination keeps your future options open. For example, aspiring doctors should take Biology, Chemistry, and Math.

### 3. Understand Subject Groups
Many schools and certification bodies like Cambridge group subjects into:
- **Languages**
- **Humanities**
- **Sciences**
- **Mathematics**
- **Creative/Vocational**

Balanced choices across these groups can qualify you for awards like the ICE (International Certificate of Education).

### 4. Talk to People
- Teachers can guide you based on your performance
- Parents may offer insights from their experience
- Friends may have useful suggestions too — but remember, choose what’s right for *you*

### 5. Consider Workload
Some subjects are more theory-based, while others are project-heavy. Be realistic about how much you can manage.
